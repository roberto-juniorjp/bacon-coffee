# Bacon Coffee ðŸ¥“

This project was made as a initial **challenge to join Bichinhos da TI volunteer work**. I halted this one as the main project at Bichinhos is starting. I learned many skills and technologies with this project.
## Description ðŸ“‘
We had a briefing that asked for a solution at a coffee shop that needed to handle high demands. Main functions are the shop, order, checkout and admin.
